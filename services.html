        		<p>To transform the colossal women force into an effective human resource, Enactus MLNC under its project PARIVARTAN, works with a group of underprivileged women (who reside in the Sanjay Gandhi Camp, Chanakyapuri, Delhi), to manufacture dog merchandise. This capacitates these women to ensure a permanent source of income. Their products are sold under the brand name - "BeDesi". These are made with love, guaranteeing the best quality and durability. The proceeds from their sale go primarily to the underprivileged women; and a portion is used to sustain the project. This makes our Auntrepreneurs self-reliant and economically independent. Women have to resist many structural barriers, stereotypes, and social and cultural norms of the society for their rights and entitlements. Correct efforts are required for their development and participation in the entrepreneurial activities. Project Parivartan bridges the gap between talent and opportunity for these women, enabling them to enhance their income for a better living standard and helping to build solidarity within the community.</p>

        		<p>Indian street dogs have evolved overtime into a hardy species, battling an unforgiving environment, intolerant humans and the vagaries of nature. Unfortunately, fear and ignorance have led many people nationwide to see these dogs as nothing but a nuisance and to seek their eradication using inhumane methods. An estimated 35 million stray dogs live in India and according to the World Health Organization(WHO), India faces about 18,000 to 20,000 cases of rabies every year. This is caused partially by the stray dog population in the country and partially by poor treatment for rabies. The most considerate solution for controlling their population and preventing rabies is sterilization and immunization. In 2014, Enactus MLNC stepped up with the aim of eradicating rabies through the DESI model. DESI stands for “Duty to Empathize, Sterilise and Immunize”. Enactus MLNC believes that dogs deserve as much love and respect as any other living being. Hence the ‘duty to empathize’. Under the ‘duty to sterilize and immunize’, the stray dogs are sterilized and immunized with the cooperation and help of animal welfare NGOs. Sterilization is a potent way to control the population of stray dogs as it stops further reproduction. According to PETA, sterilization of one female dog prevents approximately 67,000 births for over seven years. Immunization, on the other hand, eliminates the risk of rabies. The DESI model is implemented as a result of collaborations between the RWA/educational institutes/offices and the animal welfare NGO of the concerned area. Partnerships have been formed with NGOs like Friendicoes, Paws, and SGACC. It was first implemented in Sector 50 Noida. Later, dogs of Gurgaon, Satya Niketan and colleges like Sri Venkateswara, Hindu, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and of course Motilal Nehru were both sterilized and immunized. “The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.” Very often, dogs are at the receiving end of the anger, and sometimes, just plain sadism from people. There is no justification for abuse and cruelty towards any living creature, which includes stray dogs as well. Dogs are without the ambivalence with which humans seem cursed. The DESI model identifies education and compassion as the key to the peaceful co-existence of humans and animals; and adopts scientific and humane methods to make the lives of stray dogs better. <br><h3>Partnerships have been formed with PETA, Friendicoes, Paws and SGACC.</h3><br>

              The unsafe disposal of child faeces is a common practice in India and is a significant source of exposure to faecal pathogens, besides being a common sanitation problem that contributes to adverse health outcomes. In many low-income settings, diapers are rarely available or used, making the hygienic collection of infant faeces difficult. Only 11% of children's faeces are disposed of safely. More than 80% are left in the open places as garbage. To curb this problem, Enactus MLNC has come up with Project Sneh. In this project, cloth diapers are manufactured by a set of workers from Streebal NGO, for the children of indigent families. One of the most common misperceptions about cloth diapers is that they are difficult to use and maintain. Modern cloth diapers are just as easy to change and maintain as a disposable diaper. In addition to it, they have many benefits over disposables. They are eco-friendly, cost-effective, washable, absorbent, reusable, light and breathable. Around 24,700,000,000 disposables end up In landfills each year. Adding to the concern, there’s another scary statistic about disposables — how much money the struggling families are spending on them. While parents spend thousands to diaper one baby if they use disposable diapers, they would require to spend only a fraction of it on buying cloth diapers and laundering them. Cloth diapers contain no chemicals such as chlorine, perfumes or polyacrylate (a chemical used for absorbency). From exposure to these chemicals, your infant can develop severe skin irritations, a fever, vomiting and staph infections. Hence Project Sneh bridges the gap between means and opportunity. It is a step towards better sanitation, health and hygiene of children of many households. It also has a positive impact on the environment and strengthens the concept of ‘reduce, reuse and recycle.
